    "body": "### Welcome to SSCTV2\r\nSteam Server Creation Tool V2 (SSCTV2) is an advanced, user-friendly GUI utility designed to streamline the process of downloading, installing, and managing multiplayer game servers via SteamCMD. Built to simplify server setup for games on the Steam platform, SSCTV2 eliminates the need for complex console commands, offering an intuitive interface for both beginners and experienced users.\r\n\r\n#### Getting Started\r\nTo get SSCTV2 up and running:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Download the latest release from GitHub: https://github.com/n0tic/Steam-Server-Creation-Tool-V2/releases\r\n2. Extract the files to your desired directory.\r\n3. Run `Steam Server Creation Tool V2.exe` and follow the on-screen prompts.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptional: Enable the AutoUpdater by placing `AutoUpdater.exe` in the same folder and checking 'Allow AutoUpdater' in settings.\r\n\r\n### Key Features\r\n- **Dynamic Server List**: SSCTV2 fetches an up-to-date list of available servers directly from Steam’s API, ensuring compatibility even as Steam adds or removes servers.\r\n- **Easy Installation**: Select your game, set your install path, and let SSCTV2 handle the rest—no manual SteamCMD scripting required.\r\n- **AutoUpdater**: Keep your tool current with automatic updates (optional feature).\r\n- **Customization**: Configure server settings post-installation with ease.\r\n\r\nSupported games include a wide range of Steam titles with dedicated servers—check the app’s live database for the latest options.\r\n\r\n### Manual Setup\r\nFor advanced users, SSCTV2 still supports direct SteamCMD interaction. Simply configure your settings manually after installation or tweak the generated scripts. Note: Passwords in scripts are stored in clear text if you use the login feature—use with caution!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by n0tic (@n0tic).
